It has been about 4 months since I started working at [Branch](https://branch.io) and wanted
to reflect on what it's been like.

I can truly say that I'm enjoying everything about it. The environment is
fantastic, my co-workers are awesome, and we all come from various backgrounds.

I like the fact that the company takes their values seriously and the founding team is
focused on making working at Branch the best experience you've ever had
in your career. There's also a very strong focus on diversity as the
founding team puts it: The more diverse we are, the better we will
be positioned in the long run. Being more diverse allow us to bring in
different points of view and experiences that in the end help us
progress more efficiently. I can't say that there are many places like that.

I work in the Data Platform team handling all the infrastructure
where our data pipelines run on. I get to work with some the latest technologies
like all things containers, Kubernetes, Mesos, AWS, Spark, Flink, Java, Scala, Go, etc.

The culture is big on trying new things, and if for some reason things don't work out,
 we can learn from the experience and move forward. For example, when somebody makes a mistake the
focus is not about pointing who was at fault but rather look at it from the point
of view of analyzing what happened and what can be done to avoid the same
mistakes in the future.

I'm looking forward to many more exciting years/months at Branch!
