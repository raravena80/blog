Some still viewed AI as an outlier in the cloud-native world. But if KubeCon EU proved anything, AI has now fully arrived—and the community is building it in a cloud native way.
This year&amp;rsquo;s event didn&amp;rsquo;t just validate the momentum around AI; it showcased a CNCF community that&amp;rsquo;s actively rethinking its foundations—from how Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) work to how the community serves end users to how projects grow and graduate.</description></item><item><title>CNCF Cloud Native AI Working Group: Innovation from Edge to Core!</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/cncf-cloud-native-ai-working-group-innovation-from-edge-to-core/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/cncf-cloud-native-ai-working-group-innovation-from-edge-to-core/</guid><description>Over the past six months, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&amp;rsquo;s (CNCF) Cloud Native AI (CNAI) Working Group has been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud-native technologies. This is a moment to discuss the working group&amp;rsquo;s initiatives and opportunities for contributors and enthusiasts as we prepare for KubeCon Europe 2025 in London.
The group has been making strides in galvanizing the community around the needs of AI/ML workloads on top of cloud native environments.</description></item><item><title>Fun Times at The Kubernetes Forum Seoul and Sydney 2019</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/kubernetes-forum-seoul-sydney/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/kubernetes-forum-seoul-sydney/</guid><description>Hello everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to write this post about my experience at the Kubernetes Forum Seoul and Sydney 2019. My journey started in San Francisco on Friday evening, December 6th, 2019, on a flight to Seoul.
I arrived in Seoul on Sunday, December 8th, in the morning and had plenty of time during the day to rest in the hotel at the venue, The Seoul Dragon City. As speakers, we were invited along with the organizers and community leaders to an event dinner in the Goguryeo room.</description></item><item><title>Speaking</title><link>http://localhost:1313/page/speaking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><author>raravena80@gmail.com (Ricardo Aravena)</author><guid>http://localhost:1313/page/speaking/</guid><description>Speaking Engagements A curated collection of talks and presentations I&amp;rsquo;ve given from 2018-2025, covering cloud-native technologies, container runtimes, security, and AI infrastructure.
